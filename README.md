# WML Syntax Highlighting

This is a small syntax highlighting extention for the Wesnoth Markup Language (WML). It is used to create addons for Battle for Wesnoth.

> Please use the WML color theme to get the best results!

### Battle for Wesnoth 
is an [open source](https://opensource.org/faq#osd), turn-based strategy game with a high fantasy theme. It features both singleplayer and online/hotseat multiplayer combat.

### How to Use/Install the version 2.0.0 with LSP support
1. Install a Java runtime (JRE), like from [here](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/).
2. Uninstall previous version and install the VSIX extension from this repo (available from latest CI runs, check Actions tab above).
3. Open an Addon folder with a valid `_main.cfg` via the Open Folder VSCode option. Enter Wesnoth gamedata path and userdata path in the prompt after you install it.
4. That's it. You will get success indication like this:

### Supported LSP features:
* Go To Definition for WML macro calls.
* Hover info for WML macro calls.
* Completion for macro directives and macro calls.
* Hover info for WML paths. Show image preview if path is image.
* Completion for tag names.
* Shows help page link for tag names on hover.
* Preliminary Wesnoth path autocomplete. (Triggered by '/')

Note: this is still very much a prototype. Please be forgiving and report any errors you come across. A log is usually available in Output tab in VSCode under WML LSP Server category.
